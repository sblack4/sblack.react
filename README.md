based off [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript)

1. install all the node_modules 
```javascript
npm install
```
2. start the dev server 
`npm run start`
3. declare done and publish 
`npm run build-deploy`
this also copies everything over to the front of the master branch.  There was a reason behind this that I have since forgotten. TODO will fix
4. let git know everything's good
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "finished everything goodly"
git push
```
